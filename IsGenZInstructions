A member of GenZ is someone born between 1997 and 2015 (inclusive). Using boundary analysis write test cases to test the IsGenZ function which already exists and you can call using:

GenZHelper.IsGenZ(<year>)

that takes a year of birth (in the Gregorian Calendar) and returns true if the person is a member of GenZ and false if it isn't. If the year is not a valid Gregorian Calendar year then the function throws IllegalArgumentException.



Note: The expected number of cases is 13.
